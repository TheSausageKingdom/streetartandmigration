							<div class="gallery-single-article">
								<p>Nowadays when we mention Banksy's name in a conversation on art, it is pretty rare to encounter question such as "Who is it?". He is one of the most famous artists of our era. He has been on the graffiti scene since the early 1990s and made his name in the whole world with controversial art that we can recognize at the first look. The identity of the artist remains unknown, even after all this time, creating a mystery around him and his art that we call the "Banksy Effect".  It is commonly assumed that he might be British, even native from Bristol but we truly know nothing.  It seems that even his own family doesn't know who he is and it's truly fascinating. </p>
								<p>I previously told that Banksy's style was recognisable. The street artist uses what we call stencils, an idea that he got one day after his crew left him to flee the cops. As he was stuck beneath a garbage truck, he saw the stencil letters on the truck and decided that it would be his new graffiti type. And nowadays, we find those stencils everywhere. He also paints, as we can see in his hotel named "The Walled Off Hotel" in Israel.  </p>
								<p>Listing his famous artwork would probably be too long so we will simply list the theme he often uses in his artwork. As an engaged artist, Banksy covers the world's issues and inconsistencies as well as he denounces unfair policies and treatment with humour, provocation and poetry, always accompanied by an idea of anticapitalism and pacifism. As far as we know, he covered racist and hate problems, unfair migrant treatments, ecology debates and policies, wars, poverty... in Australia, England, the United States, France, Israel, Jamaica and even Canada. In 2010, he also became an accomplished author and filmmaker through his film "Exit Through the Gift Shop" and recently, his "Devolved Parliament" painting has been sold for about £9.9 million (making it the most expensive Bansky ever sold). </p>
								<p>But today we talk about migration. And even if his other artworks are fascinating, we have enough content for months when it comes to migration-related works. You may have understood it by now, but Banksy always has something to say on policies.  No need to say that the artist does not agree with most of nowadays migration policies, if it was the contrary, we would have nothing to analyse.   </p>
								<p>He commented on Calais and the border policies that prevented migrants and refugees from crossing the Channel by creating and installing three artworks in the city: we could find Steve Jobs carrying a bundle and an 80s like computer in "the Jungle"  (a migrants and refugees camp in the vicinity of Calais), a remake of Géricault's "Radeau de la Méduse" that, instead of depicting the rescue of the castaways by the Argus, is showing migrants desperately trying to reach the ferry-bus that could take them to Dover and, the third one, a child looking through a spy-glass to see England and a vulture eyeing the child, perched on the spy-glass. </p>
								<p>Taking those three artworks different from one another, we can establish a sample of Banksy's art.  Three different to interact with potential viewers, three different ways to show them the issues.  </p>
									<div class="gallery-single-img">
									<img src="img/gallery-single/25.jpg" width="80%" />
									</div>
								<p>First of all, let's start with the revisited " Le Radeau de la Méduse".  If one thing is recurrent in Banksy's artwork, it's his manner to remake famous work of art such as paintings and sculptures to fit his ideas and his comments. He often, almost always, uses sarcasm to make people stop and watch it closer. Sarcasm on different scales can bring different feeling. With "Le Radeau de la Méduse", Banksy uses what we can call a simple sarcasm.  </p>
								<p>In the original painting, the message is already pretty clear: people are drowning, starving on a raft. They need help. Someone to help them. Their only hope is a tiny ship far on the horizon. Banksy chose to change minor details. He did not change the characters on the raft. After all, castaways are similar to migrants or refugees when they are drowning while crossing seas, arent' they? Banksy changed the ship and added thought bubbles showing "£" and with it, the whole interpretation. Migrants cannot access to the ferry-bus that could take them to England and to a better life and so are stuck in Calais, "drowning" under the terrible conditions of living that they have. Showing the boat far away, not reachable, is ironically pitiful. Banksy is showing us that they will "drown" if they stay where they are, in their misery.  </p>
								<p>This is simple sarcasm if we have to name it. People that have no idea of what's going on can easily understand what it means and be affected by it. Sadly if you go to Calais, you'll not be able to see this beautiful stencil as the owner of the wall decided to cover it even though the municipality had promised to protect it. But you'll still be able to see the other two. </p>
								<p>The second one that we will be analysing is what I call a dark sarcasm. What is dark sarcasm you say? Well, let me explain it to you through the analysis of the little boy and his spying-glass. </p>
									<div class="gallery-single-img">
									<img src="img/gallery/21.jpg"/>
									</div>
								<p>The little boy with his spying glass can be found near the shore, in Calais still, and depicts a young boy watching the sea (and what's beyond) with a spying glass with a vulture perched on it. At first, when you look at it, you can't understand what Banksy means. You only see what's shown and not the message. 
									Let's take a second look, shall we? </p>
								<p>The little boy is a migrant. He is looking across the Channel in the hope to see England and with that a better future. In the spying glass, he holds his expectations, his dreams.  And the vulture? The vulture is everything else. The government and the laws that won't let him pass, the hunger he might endure, all the things in the world that will eat him alive or just kill him. </p>
								<p>This is dark sarcasm. It's the sarcasm that you can't understand with the first look. The sarcasm that leaves you a weak smile and a mind full of worries. In Banksy's work, it's the sarcasm that will make you think twice and that will leave you silent and thoughtful. </p>
								<p>And it's the essence of Banksy's work. It makes you think. It makes you draw the connection by yourself. </p>
								<p>It makes you realize what kind of world you're in. </p>

							<h2>Ai Weiwei</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><span>Where:</span>New York City / Prague</li>
								<li><span>Date:</span>Sometime</li>
								<li><span>What:</span>Exposition</li>
							</ul>

							<div class="gallery-single-article">
								<p>Ai Weiwei is a Chinese modern artist and activist, he was born on the 28th of August 1957 in Beijing. His father Being one of the most famous contemporary Chinese poets was critical of the Chinese government which  lead to his arrest in 1957 as a political prisoner after being accused of “rightism” Ai Weiwei is not only known for his artistic career but also the struggle he went through to be able to express his creativity in China, and the constant harassment and arrests he was subjected to both himself and the people around him, and the disappearance of people he knows in those arrests.</p>
								<p>He lived in the United States from 1981 to 1993. He was one of the first generation of students to study abroad following China's reform in 1980. The reason for his return to his home country was because of his father’s illness yet on his return and on his rise to fame he was met with discrimination and suppression by the government for his critical views. Which lead to his famous arrest in 2011 at Beijing Capital International Airport on the 3rd of April, where he was held for 81 days without charge and released with allegations of "economic crimes". After one year of being released and finally being allowed to leave the country, he went to Germany where he moved yet again and lived a life of estrangement which plays a big role in his engagement in the migration cause, being a person who experienced first hand what it means to be suppressed and forced into exile. This life experience not only added to his artistic sincerity and the value of his work when it comes to migration, but also an incentive for people to listen to his opinion when it comes to this particular subject.
								</p>
								<p>Ai Weiwei has multiple migration works of art but unlike other artists he is very politically engaged and does not shy away from taking sides. He is not morally ambiguous in fact he is very assertive and unequivocal on of his views, his message and his support for migrants is very clear, his art reflects both his struggle as an artist and demonstrates the tragedy that is this modern crisis.
								</p>
								<p>His works dealing with migration subjects are numerous and each is unique in its own way, in fact it wouldn't be a surprise if one took each of his works for another artist's because of their ingenuity and the drastic differences between each one, from documentaries to works in galleries 70 meters in size to small fences all over New York. In this short analysis of the artist we will try to discuss briefly his most famous works dealing with migrant issues and how it counters the geopolitical sphere.
								</p>

								<p>Law of the Journey, his first exhibition in the Czech Republic at the National Gallery in Prague,  representing the time Ai Weiwei spent reflecting on the migration cause with a staggering 70 meter long boat with 258 refugees, displayed inside of the gallery as an homage to the people affected by the crisis around the world. The boat depicts the arduous journey where refugees were and are at the time being forced to cross the sea to find refuge in less dangerous countries than their own. Knowing Ai Weiwei's life and the major events that played into shaping his artistic integrity, we can interpret the boat not only as a symbolic figure that represents the crossing of the Mediterranean Sea and the journey of the people fleeing from war, but also as a correlation to ai Weiwei's own journey from one country to another to find a second home, after being subjected to torture in prison by his own corrupt police, in an attempt to silence his voice. </p>
								<p><i>“Himself a refugee, Ai has almost entirely focused his work on advocating the refugees’ human rights and documenting their tragic condition throughout the past two years. He has visited dozens of places struggling with humanitarian crisis. The exhibition Law of the Journey is a multi-layered, epic statement on the human condition: an artist’s expression of empathy and moral concern in the face of continuous, uncontrolled destruction and carnage,”</i> says the National Gallery’s Director General, Jiří Fajt.</p>

									</div>
								<p>Presented by Public Art Fund in its 40th anniversary with collaboration with Ai Weiwei, the second event we will be attempting to analyze was created, it is Ai's most renown and ambitious art project to date, named Good Fences Make Good Neighbors which was a 300 art pieces distributed all over NYC. Ai Weiwei tackles the Mexican-American border crossing but also the new surge of ethnic racism and the trump border wall. Ai Weiwei not only denounces these policies but also argues the need for a border wall in the first place. One of the reasons Ai Weiwei chose NYC as location was because it is an extremely well known location, and for being a Metropol of ethnic diversity and tolerance, but most importantly because it was President Trump's home city.
								</p>
								<p>His art disposition were in all sorts of shapes and arrangements but sharing a common theme of fences, such as the bus stop fences that were also made with their own small seats, in a sort of interactive art, this concept of movement and stagnation of fences made a poignant contrast between his art and the very structure of the city itself, attesting to the artistic genius that is So Weiwei. 
								</p>
								<p>The 12 meter tall cage-like structure installed under the New York’s iconic Washington Square Arch. Made out of polished stainless steel. The structure appears to be the silhouette of two human beings crossing through the steep structure. A very symbolic and strong work of art, very open to interpretation and beautiful to the eye. One interpretation and meaning that could be drawn from it is how difficult it is for the families affected by the crisis to cross into another land, representing this crossing using what is a 12 meter steel fence, the crossing itself can be represented as having a will of steel in order to make it across.
								</p>
								<p>His second biggest art piece and the one that noted the most attention from the press was the Gilded cage which was a beautiful golden cage with a rotating gate on the inside of it. But contrary to his other sculptures, what brought so much attention to this one was not the cage itself or the symbolic meaning it represented, but the location it was installed in. Right near Trump Tower; president Trump's building located at the southeast entrance to Central Park. Fans were ready to speculate on the meaning and if the theories for choosing this location had anything to do with Trump which Ai confirmed on an interview in 2017 on a TV show called Now democracy. Even adding that his choice for the color gold was because president Trump's own admittance to liking the color, saying it was to bring his attention. This clear declaration of defiance seems to align perfectly with what Ai Weiwei is known to be, a rebel artist. His willingness to bring attention to such a big issue in the world disregarding for his safety is a signature trait of Ai's work. He both appeals to our human emotions on a personal level and going against the norm by challenging the political powers that control the world and refuse to deal with the crisis.
								</p>
								<p>Other arts that are just as important as our two examples are the Human flow documentary and the art displayed in Berlin/Denmark and many other locations in Europe using life jackets used by migrants crossing the sea.</p>
								<p>An artist, an activist, a filmmaker and struggler of migration, Ai's work may branch into different categories, but it shares one common theme that everyone at the moment shares and is affected by; through his work Ai explores what it means to be an immigrant and what is society's role toward displaced populations. In an attempt to bring people together through his work, Ai Weiwei's style and message can be described as nothing else but revolutionary and historical.
